    <h3>Sakib Ak Hasan</h3>
    <P>Shakib Al Hasan is without a doubt the biggest name to have emerged from Bangladesh cricket circles. Being a genuine all-rounder, Shakib is a vital cog in Bangladesh's line-up. He has been a consistent performer for his country, over the years. Shakib first came into notice when he played cricket for several villages near his hometown of Magura. He spent time honing his skills at a government run sports facility and was picked for the Under-19 squad for the tri-series featuring England and Sri Lanka. He scored a 86-ball century and picked up three wickets in the final to help the team defeat Sri Lanka. This earned him selection for the series against Zimbabwe.</P>

            <h3>Taskin Ahmed</h3>
            <p>A tall, right-hand fast bowler, Taskin Ahmed grabbed headlines at a very young age - thanks to his pace. He is currently the second fastest Bangladeshi bowler having clocked 148kph (the fastest is Rubel's 149.5kph). He made his first-class debut in the 2011 season playing for Dhaka Metropolis at the age of 16. He was selected for the Under-19 World Cup which was held in Australia in the year 2012. Taskin ended up as the leading wicket-taker in that tournament. Playing in just his second T20 match for Chittagong Kings in the 2013 edition of the Bangladesh Premier League, Taskin was named the Man of the Match for his splendid figures of 4/31.</p>

            <h3>Tamim Iqbal</h3>
            <p>When the world talks about the sub-continental openers, they talk about the aggression factor. Virender Sehwag, Sanath Jayasuriya and Sachin Tendulkar have ruthlessly destroyed the bowling over the years. However, an opener from Bangladesh soon joined that list and made the world take notice.He scored his first century against Ireland, but it was his knock against Zimbabwe at Harare in 2009 which got him top billing. Charles Coventry remained unbeaten when he equalled Saeed Anwar's highest ODI score of 194. However, Tamim launched a brutal counterattack to smash the highest score by a Bangladeshi batsman. His 154 included seven fours and six sixes as Bangladesh went on to win the match.

    <h2>Play Type</h2>

    <div class="last">
        <h3 class="long">Batsman</h3>
        <p>There are two batsman up at a time, and the batsman being bowled to (the striker) tries to hit the ball away from the wicket. A hit may be defensive or offensive. A defensive hit may protect the wicket but leave the batsmen no time to run to the opposite wicket. In that case the batsmen need not run, and play will resume with another bowl. If the batsman can make an offensive hit, he and the second batsman (the nonstriker) at the other wicket change places. Each time both batsmen can reach the opposite wicket, one run is scored. Providing they have enough time without being caught out and dismissed, the batsmen may continue to cross back and forth between the wickets, earning an additional run for each time both reach the opposite side.</p>

    <div class="conten">
        <h3 class="long">Bowler</h3>
        <p>Bowling can be right- or left-arm. For a fair delivery, the ball must be propelled, usually overhand, without bending the elbow. The bowler may run any desired number of paces as a part of his delivery (with the restriction, of course, that he not cross the popping crease). The ball generally hits the ground (the pitch) before reaching the batsman, although it need not. The first requisite of a good bowler is command of length—i.e., the ability to pitch (bounce) the ball on a desired spot, usually at or slightly in front of the batsman’s feet. The location varies with the pace of the bowler, the state of the pitch, and the reach and technique of the batsman. The second requisite is command of direction.</p>
